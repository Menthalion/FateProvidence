# Fate & Providence

*A Fate universal skill variant*



## Rationale
Fate & Providence (F&P) is a universal skill variant designed to fall between Fate Condensed skills and Fate Accelerated approaches. It is intended to respect Fate philosophy, be setting agnostic, flexible and symmetrical. This manual will only cover the differences between F&P and Fate Condensed.



## Overview

### Scores

The basis of F&P is a list of 10 skills, which cover all possible actions in a flexible and proactive way. Their starting scores are identical to Fate Condensed:

- one great/+4 skill
- two good/+3 skills
- three fair/+2 skills
- four average/+1 skills
- no mediocre/+0 skills

### Narrative license
To decide if someone can use the skill rank in a certain context, it needs a narrative license check: does the described action match the user's aspects / stunts ? If so use the skill rank, if not use a score of mediocre/+0 instead.

If narrative license is partly applicable the skill rank may be used, but

- On overcome actions the difficulty should be increased (suggested +2)
- On opposed actions the opposition will get a boost, which can be compelled for free once. The boost can be negated by spending a fate point.

## Stunts

### Stunt families
Because of narrative license, there is no direct relationship between stunts and skills / approaches like in Fate Condensed. This adds more flexibility in skill use, but demands a defined narrative scope for them.

F&P uses Fate Core [stunt families](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/building-stunts#stunt-families) for this: every stunt needs to be part of a family to define their scope.  A stunt family cannot be invoked, and does not grant bonusses itself.

Aspects can not be used as a skill family, since aspects loss or change would conflict with stunt development. Aspects are also encouraged to be combinations, while stunt families should be very broad but distinct entities. Stunt families can mirror partial aspects to apply stunts to.

> Brian the Monster Slaying Accountant has narrative license to use his skill ranks when Monster Slaying or Accounting. When he wants to add a stunt that has to do with Accounting, he needs to create a stunt family for it first.

#### Stunt family limit tracker
Stunt families can have a point tracker to limit the use of specific skills belonging to the family. The description of these skills should include the limit cost per use. The limit tracker should have a capacity and contain a description of the consequences when filled up, as well as how points can be replenished.

### Broad stunts
Broad stunts give a +1 bonus on actions within a specified scope that covers a sixth of the family scope at most. Broad skill bonuses do not stack with bonus-granting skills or other broad stunts.

### Rule-changing stunts

Rule changing stunts work mostly identical to Fate Condensed except for:

#### Using an action with a skill that isnâ€™t normally used with it

Narrative license and stunt families already cover most of these cases, which means a bonus-granting skill would be superior in specific situations.


## Skills

### The List

##### Notice

*observe by power: spot / scan / empathize*

-  ###### Overcome
  In passing notice the presence or superficial state of a target. Only roll when failure or success are equally interesting.

- ###### Defend
  Notice covert 'create an advantage' actions.

##### Inspect 
*observe by mastery: search / study / analyze*

- ######  Overcome
  Interact with a target or its situation to reveal information or an aspect.

- ######  Create an advantage
  Interact with a target or its situation to reveal a structural or situational strength or weakness.

##### Apply
*achieve by power: exert / know / charm*

- ###### Overcome
  Surmount an obstacle by applying force, without degrading its structure or situation.

- ###### Create an advantage
  Improve your situation by applying force without degrading another's structure or situation.

##### Handle
*achieve by mastery: maneuver / reason / influence*

- ###### Overcome
  Surmount an obstacle by applying skill, without degrading its structure or situation.

- ###### Create an advantage
  Improve your situation by skill, without degrading another's structure or situation.

##### Support

*improve by power: reinforce / source / rally*

- ###### Overcome
  Introduce an already existing target from supplies.  Extra or lacking shifts influence price, quality or time.

- ###### Create an advantage
  Improve a target's structure or situation by applying supplies to it.

- ###### Special
  Determines the amount of resource stress boxes by offset (default: 2) + resist skill

##### Develop

*improve by mastery: craft / plan / counsel*

- ###### Overcome
  Create a new or original target. Lacking time and components / conditions influence difficulty.
  
  Restore the structure of / remove a condition on a target.
  
- ######   Create an advantage
  Improve target's structure or situation by skillfully modifying it.

##### Force

*undo by power: assault / cite / coerce*

- ###### Attack
  Degrade the structure of a target by force.

- ###### Create an advantage
  Degrade the situation of a target by force.

##### Control

*undo by mastery: aim / argue / deceive*

- ###### Attack
  Degrade the structure of a target by skill.

- ###### Create an advantage
  Degrade the situation of a target by skill. Can be done covertly.

##### Resist
*endure by power: block / focus / brave*

- ###### Defend
  Defend against an action by withstanding its effects. If the effect is shifts of stress, a proxy *(like a shield)* is needed to absorb them.

- ###### Special
  Determines the amount of personal stress boxes by offset (default: 2) + resist skill.

##### Evade
*endure by mastery: dodge / disprove / reject*

- ###### Defend
  Defend against an action by evading its effects.

### Ambiguous actions
Every skill in the list has a mirror: one governed by power, one by mastery. If it is ambiguous which applies to a stated action *(like a short sword attack)*, you can use the highest of the two.

### Challenges
Since skills are tied to specific types of actions, they might turn one roll skill checks in core Fates into consecutive ones / challenges in F&P. Use these as opportunities for narrative instead of extra busywork. If some become routine and lack tension, suggest the player make it a bonus stunt on the higher skill, or offer the table to make it a free swap stunt.

### Teamwork
For teamwork to apply, both characters need to have narrative license to use a skill. If the narrative licenses of participants are in opposition *(like a faith healer assisting a surgeon)*, the table decides.

## Creation and progression

Character creation and progression follow Fate Condensed like the rest of the rules except for the following:

### Stunt families

A new character gets his first stunt family for free. Because every family extra increases access to all ranked skills, they need to be bought. The second family costs 2 refresh, the third and last one costs 4.

### Stress tracks
There are two stress tracks: one for personal and one for resource stress, governed by the *resist* and *support* skills respectively. 

### Milestones
Rewrite one stunt includes moving a stunt to another family.

### Breakthroughs
Another action applies to a breakthrough:
Rewrite a stunt family that does not contain any stunts, if you care to.

## Addenda

### Evolution
*optional information*

The skill list originated in an experiment with a multi-column Fate, with an act and origin column:

| Act     | Origin   |
| ------- | -------- |
| Observe | Brawn    |
| Achieve | Grace    |
| Improve | Data     |
| Undo    | Logic    |
| Endure  | Presence |
|         | Tact     |

Multi-column progression math or a using the cross-product 30 item skill list resulted in too much crunch.

Splitting up the origin column into realm (*material, conceptual, spiritual*) and style (*power, mastery*) columns made it possible to abstract away most of the realm axis with the use of narrative license. This left only the act column and style column cross-product for a total of 10 skills.

| Act     | Power   | Mastery |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Observe | Notice  | Inspect |
| Achieve | Apply   | Handle  |
| Improve | Support | Create  |
| Undo    | Force   | Control |
| Endure  | Resist  | Evade   |

The original table and axes can still be useful as categorization for scoping stunts. The canonical names for the original 30 skills are still in use as skill  examples in the format *act* by *style: material / conceptual / spiritual*

|             |  *power*   | *mastery*  |   *power*    |  *mastery*   |   *power*    |  *mastery*  |
| ----------: | :--------: | :--------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: | :---------: |
|             | *material* | *material* | *conceptual* | *conceptual* | *spiritual*  | *spiritual* |
|             | **Brawn**  | **Grace**  |   **Data**   |  **Logic**   | **Presence** |  **Tact**   |
| **Observe** |    spot    |   search   |     scan     |    study     |  empathize   |   analyze   |
| **Achieve** |   exert    |  maneuver  |     know     |    reason    |    charm     |  influence  |
| **Improve** | reinforce  |   craft    |    source    |     plan     |    rally     |   counsel   |
|    **Undo** |  assault   |    aim     |     cite     |    argue     |    coerce    |   deceive   |
|  **Endure** |   block    |   dodge    |    focus     |   disprove   |    brave     |   reject    |
