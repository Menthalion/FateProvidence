# Fate & Providence

*A Fate universal skill variant*



## Rationale
Fate & Providence (F&P) is a universal skill variant designed to fall between Fate Core / Condensed skills and Fate Accelerated approaches. It is intended to respect the Fate philosophy, be setting agnostic and symmetrical. This manual will only cover the differences between F&P and core Fates.



## Overview

### Scores

The basis of F&P is a list of 10 skills, which cover all possible actions in a flexible and proactive way. Their starting scores are identical to Fate Core:  1x rank 4, 2x rank 3, 3x rank 2, 4x rank 1. There are no rank 0 skills.

### Narrative license
To decide if someone can use the skill rank in a certain context, it needs a narrative license check: does the described action match the user's aspects / stunts ? If so use the skill rank, if not use a score of 0 instead.

If narrative license is partly applicable the skill rank may be used, but

- On overcome actions the difficulty should be increased (suggested +2)
- On opposed actions the opposition will get a boost, which can be compelled for free once. The boost can be negated by spending a fate point.



## Stunts
Because of narrative license, there is no direct relationship between stunts and skills / approaches like in core Fates. To add this narrative structure, we make use of Fate Core's optional [stunt families](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/building-stunts#stunt-families): in F&P every stunt needs to be part of one. 

### Stunt families
Stunt families act as narrative license like aspects, but cannot be invoked. They need to be bought with refresh points; since each stunt family added doubles the narrative license to use all ranked skills, refresh costs doubles as well: 1 for the first, 2 for the second, 4 for the third... 

Aspects cannot be used directly as the root of a skill family. This is to prevent aspect loss / change to conflict with stunt development. Aspects are also encouraged to be combinations, while stunt families should be very broad but distinct entities. Stunt families can mirror 

#### Stunt family limit tracker
Stunt families can have a tracker to limit the use of specific skills belonging to the family. The description of these skills should include the limit cost per use. The limit tracker should contain a description of the consequences when filled up, as well as how it can be replenished.

### Broad stunts
Identical to their Fate Core counterparts, broad stunts give a +1 bonus on actions. They should have a well-defined scope that is significantly smaller than their family. Broad skill bonuses do not stack: an action can only benefit from one broad stunt, and bonuses are overridden by more specialized ones.

### Swap stunts
Stunts used for adding actions to an existing skill are used far less in F&P than in core Fates, since stunts can already apply to multiple skills.

Swap stunts could still be practical in picking another (higher rated) skill than the one normally used for an action. Those should have a well-defined scope that is significantly smaller than their family.

### Bonus stunts
Identical to their Fate Core counterparts, bonus stunts give a +2 bonus in very specific situations.

- ###### Defend
  Defend against an action by evading its effects.



## Creation and Progression

Character creation and progression is identical to the core Fates, except a new character starts with 2 extra refresh points that need to be spent on stunts / stunt families before play.

Stress boxes used are Fate Condensed style 1 point each stress boxes, with tracks for personal and resource stress.



## Addenda

### Skill Categories
*optional information*

The skill list originated in an experiment with a 5x6 multi-column Fate. Multi-column progression math or a 30 item skill list turned out too crunchy to use.

Splitting up the origin axis (*brawn, grace, data, logic, presence, tact*) into the realm (*material, conceptual, spiritual*) and style (*power, mastery*) axes made it possible to abstract away most of the realm axis with the use of stunt families. This left only the act axis (*observe, achieve, improve, undo, endure*) and style axis (*power, mastery*) for a total of 10 skills.

The original table and axes can be useful as categorization for scoping stunts. The canonical names for the original 30 skills are still in use as skill  examples in the format *act* by *style: material / conceptual / spiritual*
