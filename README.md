# Fate & Providence

*A Fate universal skill variant*



## Rationale

Fate & Providence (F&P) is a universal skill variant designed to fall between Fate Core / Condensed skills and Fate Accelerated approaches. It is intended to respect the Fate philosophy, be setting agnostic and symmetrical. This manual will only cover the differences between F&P and core Fates.



## Overview

### Scores

The basis of F&P is a list of 10 skills, which cover all possible actions in a flexible and proactive way. Their starting scores are identical to Fate Core:  1x rank 4, 2x rank 3, 3x rank 2, 4x rank 1. There are no rank 0 skills.

### Narrative license

To decide if someone can use the skill rank in a certain context, it needs a narrative license check: does the described action match the user's aspects / stunts ? If so use the skill rank, if not use a score of 0 instead.

If narrative license is partly applicable the skill rank may be used, but

- On overcome actions the difficulty should be increased (suggested +2)
- On opposed actions the opposition will get a boost, which can be compelled for free once. The boost can be negated by spending a fate point.



## Stunts

Because of narrative license, there is no direct relationship between stunts and skills / approaches like in core Fates. To add this narrative structure, we make use of Fate Core's optional [stunt families](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/building-stunts#stunt-families): in F&P every stunt needs to be part of one. 

### Stunt families

Stunt families act as narrative license like aspects, but cannot be invoked. They need to be bought with refresh points; since each stunt family doubles  narrative license to use all ranked skills, refresh cost should double as well: 1 for the first, 2 for the second, 4 for the third... 

Aspects cannot be used directly as the root of a skill family. This is to prevent aspect loss / change to conflict with stunt development. Aspects are also encouraged to be combinations, while stunt families should be very broad but distinct entities. Stunt families can mirror specific sides of aspects though.

#### Stunt family limit tracker

Stunt families can have a point tracker to limit the use of specific skills belonging to the family. The description of these skills should include the limit cost per use. The limit tracker should have a capacity and contain a description of the consequences when filled up, as well as how points can be replenished.

### Broad stunts

Identical to their Fate Core counterparts, broad stunts give a +1 bonus on actions. They should have a well-defined scope that is significantly smaller than their family. Broad skill bonuses do not stack: an action can only benefit from one broad stunt, and bonuses are overridden by more specialized ones.

### Swap stunts

Stunts used for adding actions to an existing skill are used far less in F&P than in core Fates, since stunts can already apply to multiple skills.

Swap stunts could still be practical in picking another (higher rated) skill than the one normally used for an action. Those should have a well-defined scope that is significantly smaller than their family.

### Bonus stunts

Identical to their Fate Core counterparts, bonus stunts give a +2 bonus in specific situations.


## Skills

### The List

##### Notice

*observe by power: spot / scan / empathize*

- ###### Overcome

  In passing notice the presence or superficial state of a target. Only roll when failure or success are equally interesting.

- ###### Defend

  Notice covert 'create an advantage' actions.

##### Inspect 

*observe by mastery: search / study / analyze*

- ######  Overcome

  Interact with a target or its situation to reveal information or an aspect.

- ######  Create an advantage

  Interact with a target or its situation to reveal a structural or situational strength or weakness.

##### Apply

*achieve by power: exert / know / charm*

- ###### Overcome

  Surmount an obstacle by applying force, without degrading its structure or situation.

- ###### Create an advantage

  Improve your situation by applying force without degrading another's structure or situation.

##### Handle

*achieve by mastery: maneuver / reason / influence*

- ###### Overcome

  Surmount an obstacle by applying skill, without degrading its structure or situation.

- ###### Create an advantage

  Improve your situation by skill, without degrading another's structure or situation.

##### Support

*improve by power: reinforce / source / rally*

- ###### Overcome

  Introduce an already existing target from supplies.  Extra or lacking shifts influence price, quality or time.

- ###### Create an advantage

  Improve a target's structure or situation by applying supplies to it.

- ###### Special

  Determines the amount of resource stress boxes by offset (default: 2) + resist skill

##### Develop

*improve by mastery: craft / plan / counsel*

- ###### Overcome

  Create a new or original target. Lacking time and components / conditions influence difficulty.

  Restore the structure of / remove a condition on a target.

- ######   Create an advantage

  Improve target's structure or situation by skillfully modifying it.

##### Force

*undo by power: assault / cite / coerce*

- ###### Attack

  Degrade the structure of a target by force.

- ###### Create an advantage

  Degrade the situation of a target by force.

##### Control

*undo by mastery: aim / argue / deceive*

- ###### Attack

  Degrade the structure of a target by skill.

- ###### Create an advantage

  Degrade the situation of a target by skill. Can be done covertly.

##### Resist

*endure by power: block / focus / brave*

- ###### Defend

  Defend against an action by withstanding its effects. If the effect is shifts of stress, a proxy (like a shield) is needed to absorb them.

- ###### Special

  Determines the amount of personal stress boxes by offset (default: 2) + resist skill.

##### Evade

*endure by mastery: dodge / disprove / reject*

- ###### Defend

  Defend against an action by evading its effects.

### Ambiguous actions

Every skill in the list has a mirror: one governed by power, one by mastery. If it is ambiguous which applies to a stated action, you can use the highest of the two.

## Creation and Progression

Character creation and progression is identical to the core Fates, except a new character gets two extra refresh points that needs to be spent directly on stunts / stunt families: one point at character creation, the other at the first major milestone.

Stress track capacity for personal and resource stress are governed by the *resist* and *support* skills respectively.



## Addenda

### Evolution

*optional information*

The skill list originated in an experiment with a multi-column Fate, with an act and origin column:

| Act     | Origin   |
| ------- | -------- |
| Observe | Brawn    |
| Achieve | Grace    |
| Improve | Data     |
| Undo    | Logic    |
| Endure  | Presence |
|         | Tact     |

Multi-column progression math or a using the cross-product 30 item skill list resulted in too much crunch.

Splitting up the origin column into realm (*material, conceptual, spiritual*) and style (*power, mastery*) columns made it possible to abstract away most of the realm axis with the use of narrative license. This left only the act column and style column cross-product for a total of 10 skills.

| Act     | Power   | Mastery |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Observe | Notice  | Inspect |
| Achieve | Apply   | Handle  |
| Improve | Support | Create  |
| Undo    | Force   | Control |
| Endure  | Resist  | Evade   |

The original table and axes can still be useful as categorization for scoping stunts. The canonical names for the original 30 skills are still in use as skill  examples in the format *act* by *style: material / conceptual / spiritual*

|             |  *power*   | *mastery*  |   *power*    |  *mastery*   |   *power*    |  *mastery*  |
| ----------: | :--------: | :--------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: | :---------: |
|             | *material* | *material* | *conceptual* | *conceptual* | *spiritual*  | *spiritual* |
|             | **Brawn**  | **Grace**  |   **Data**   |  **Logic**   | **Presence** |  **Tact**   |
| **Observe** |    spot    |   search   |     scan     |    study     |  empathize   |   analyze   |
| **Achieve** |   exert    |  maneuver  |     know     |    reason    |    charm     |  influence  |
| **Improve** | reinforce  |   craft    |    source    |     plan     |    rally     |   counsel   |
|    **Undo** |  assault   |    aim     |     cite     |    argue     |    coerce    |   deceive   |
|  **Endure** |   block    |   dodge    |    focus     |   disprove   |    brave     |   reject    |
